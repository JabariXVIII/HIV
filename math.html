        <p>Letter by Aaron Harvey</p>
        <p id="MATH">For the math component, we had to find statistical evidence on our disease and write a letter to a public health official about it advocating for our design to have an impact on HIV/Aids(Letter found above). When we were creating the letter, we also went into depeer statistical data on people affected by our disease. We did research on LGBTQ+ men and found out that the rate of how many people obtaining the disease is quadratic over the years 2010 - 2016. Having the disease go down is good and needed(Graph found below).</p>

        <p>Graph by Jabari Cook</p>
        <p id="MATH">From the graph, we learned that aids is quadratic and has gone below the radar for most people but is still a disease worth fighting. Our math solution is to write a letter to a public health official advocating for our prototype.</p>
